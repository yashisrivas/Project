}

5. Technology Stack
Component	Tech
Frontend Structure	HTML
Styling	CSS (clean typography, responsive UI)

6. UI/UX Requirements

High readability for steps and ingredients.

Responsive layout for mobile + desktop.

Consistent navbar for navigation.

Clear form error messages during validation.

7. Functional Requirements

System must:

Fetch recipes asynchronously.

Validate form on client.

Append to JSON file without overwriting.

Optionally avoid duplicate titles in MVP.

Reject malformed POST data at API layer if required fields are missing.

8. Non-Functional Requirements

Fast page loads (<3 sec on normal networks).

JSON integrity maintained during concurrent writes.

Mobile responsiveness must be supported.

No authentication required in MVP.

9. Constraints

No database used initially.

JSON file is source of truth.

No user login or media upload supported yet.

Limited concurrency support due to file writes.

10. Future Enhancements

User accounts & authentication.

Recipe rating and commenting.

Favorites/bookmarking system.

Image upload support.

More filters (cuisine, diet tags, difficulty).

11. Success Metrics

100+ recipe submissions in first 2 months.

<2% form validation failure rate.

70% user return rate.

90% positive readability feedback.

12. Security Considerations

Sanitize POST inputs.

Limit payload size to avoid JSON corruption.

Add rate-limiting in future iterations.
